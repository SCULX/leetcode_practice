Use leetcode to learn algorithms

## Attention
1.If you want to check the whole leetcode exercises, just see the `main` branch.<br>
2.The `mid` branch is only a simplify version of the medium difficulty problem, with only the solution and no other compilation information included.<br>
3.Future, I may creat a new branch called `hard`,which is the collection of hard difficulty questions and have the similar function with `mid` branch.<br>
